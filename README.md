Hi, I am a developer focused on web, software, and game development, with practical experience in projects using JavaScript, React Native, Node.js, Kotlin, relational databases, and object-oriented programming. I like to code and understand the fundamentals of what I am doing, as well as discover new things to work on.

🛠️ Technologies I Use

Languages: JavaScript, C#, Kotlin, SQL

Web & Mobile: HTML, CSS, React Native, Node.js

Databases: SQLite, MySQL, Supabase

Interests:
Game Development, System Security, Interactive Systems, Mobile Development, Backend Development

One of the areas that has caught my attention, and that I am currently working toward, is system security.

I really like games, so I am currently studying how to develop my own games as a hobby.
